# social-chat-graphql-server
Social chat application server built using postgresql and graphql server

## Step-1: 

- This basic setup is pretty much common for all the graphql implementation.
- The key take away is the babel, nodemon and yarn installation. These are optional, you can choose to run any nodejs utility for auto restart.
- Infact, nodemon is getting on my nerves so I might just replace it with something else in the next branch.
- Graphiql is the final endproduct where you will be able to see the graphql queries in action.

## To run
```
> yarn start
> access the localhost:8080/graphiql 
> check the docs or type { hello } query
```
